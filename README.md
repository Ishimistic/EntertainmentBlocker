## 🎛 Usage

Once installed, **entertainmentBlocker** runs silently in the background and blocks requests automatically.

### Here's how to use it:

1. 🔒 Visit any of the blocked websites — the page won’t load.
2. 🧪 To test, open the browser console (in DevTools > background page) to see blocked URL logs.
3. 🔧 To disable or modify:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Disable or remove the extension
   - Or edit the `background.js` blocklist and reload as unpacked

> Note: There is no frontend interface — everything is handled through the background script.



## 🛠️ Customization

You can customize which websites are blocked by modifying the code directly.

### 🔧 To Add or Remove Sites:

1. Open the extension's folder.
2. Locate the `background.js` file.
3. Inside the file, you'll find an array like this:

```js
const blockedSites = [
  "*://*.netflix.com/*",
  "*://*.primevideo.com/*",
  "*://*.hotstar.com/*",
  "*://*.zee5.com/*",
  "*://*.crunchyroll.com/*",
  "*://*.animelab.com/*"
];
4. To block a new website, add its pattern to the array.
5. To unblock a website, simply remove its entry.
6. Save the file.
7. Reload the extension:
  - Go to chrome://extensions/
